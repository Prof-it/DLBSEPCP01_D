# DLBSEPCP01_D
For the course DLBSEPCP01_D Cloud Programming

Contributions are free to design the subfolder. 

Team convension: 
- Each subfolder should be used for one project/portfolio.
- Please create a subfolder with some name that is easy to identify that it is your portfolio. Try not to use student number as this repo is public.
- Each subfolder should contain the app folder for your application, the deploy folder for your terraform or other IaC deployment scripts. In case of fullstack (frontend and backend), you could package them into the app or use client and server subfolder as you wish.
- Don't expose any secretes in the source codes, follow the DevOps best practice you've learned from the course.
